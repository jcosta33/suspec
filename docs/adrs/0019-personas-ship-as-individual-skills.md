# ADR 0019: Personas ship as individual skills

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The persona catalogue describes **13 mindsets** ([`docs/personas/`](../personas/)). An earlier scaffold packed the canonical persona payloads into one consolidated `personas/SKILL.md`. That single file forced a consumer to load all personas to get any one of them, contradicting à-la-carte vendoring, and it carried mindsets that duplicate a workflow skill — a "Builder" persona says little that `write-feature` doesn't already say.

With no always-loaded skills ([0017](./0017-no-always-load-skills.md)) and activation by self-assessment ([0020](./0020-activation-by-self-assessment.md)), each persona that ships needs its own directive `description` so the agent can load *that* mindset when the work calls for it — which a consolidated file cannot provide.

## Decision

A persona ships as a standalone skill **only when its mindset adds something beyond the matching workflow skill**. By that test, **7 of the 13 mindsets ship** as individual skills at `/scaffold/.agents/skills/persona-<slug>/SKILL.md`:

- persona-architect, persona-auditor, persona-janitor, persona-migrator, persona-performance-surgeon, persona-skeptic, persona-surveyor.

The other **6 mindsets do not ship as skills** — each is carried by the matching workflow skill, where the mindset and the procedure are the same thing:

- Builder → `write-feature`; Bug Hunter → `write-bug-report`; Documentarian → `write-documentation`; Test Author → `write-testing`; Researcher → `write-research`; Lead Engineer → orchestration (no skill; a flat task template plus the orchestration mindset).

The [`docs/personas/`](../personas/) catalogue still documents all 13 mindsets and marks which 7 ship as skills. Each shipped persona body uses the fixed shape from [0013](./0013-iron-law-red-flags-pattern.md): Role / Mindset / Hard constraints / Forbidden actions / Red flags / Persona discipline.

## Consequences

- Positive: a consumer vendors only the persona mindsets their work needs; each self-activates on its own `description`.
- Positive: no duplication between a persona and a workflow skill — the mindset lives in exactly one place.
- Negative: "13 mindsets, 7 skills" needs explaining so nobody hunts for a `persona-builder` skill — handled by the catalogue marking which mindsets ship and which ride a workflow skill.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Ship all 13 as persona skills.** Six would be near-duplicates of their workflow skill, doubling the surface for no added discipline.
- **Keep one consolidated `personas/SKILL.md`.** Forces all-or-nothing loading and can't give each mindset the directive `description` that self-assessment activation depends on.
