# The `suspec` CLI

[suspec-cli](https://github.com/jcosta33/suspec-cli) owns two isolated surfaces.

- `suspec check` is a read-only deterministic checker. Facts in, diagnostics out. It runs no model or
  verification command, writes nothing, discovers no repository or artifact store, and renders no
  acceptance decision.
- `suspec setup` previews, installs, checks, or removes the canonical user-level agent policy for
  explicit Codex, Claude Code, Kimi Code, ZCode, or OpenCode targets. It owns only a neutral inline
  block in each normal native instruction file. Drift or ambiguous configuration blocks mutation.

The CLI repository owns commands, options, companions, path handling, output, exits, installation,
and runtime behavior. See its [public contract](https://github.com/jcosta33/suspec-cli#readme).

Canon owns check meaning:

- [machine contract](../../checks/checks.yaml);
- [check catalog](checks.md);
- [artifact formats](artifact-formats.md).

The checker must match the checks contract. Generated policy bytes match
[canon](../../policy/agent.md); installed blocks differ only by target line endings and terminal-newline
normalization. A parser is not a manager.
