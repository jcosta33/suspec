# Drift

Drift exists when live implementation, evidence, scope, or contract no longer matches the intent under
review.

Common cases:

- requirements or verification changed after evidence;
- judged code changed after review;
- edits escaped declared scope;
- a task diverged from its spec;
- fixtures diverged from the checks contract.

Stop using stale evidence. Identify the changed authority, reconcile intent or implementation, rerun
affected verification against the final state, and review again.

Suspec maintains no repository-wide spec baseline after close. Later work starts from current code,
tests, project decisions, and the new request. Contract fixtures remain shipped evidence and must
match the current contract.
