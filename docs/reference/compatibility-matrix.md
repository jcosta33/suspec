## Table 2: Personas × Task types

The **suggested** default lead persona per task type. ADR 0002's strict 1-to-1 mapping is superseded — these are suggested defaults the agent may re-assess (see the note below the table).

| Task type                       | Suggested lead persona        | Secondary (handoff)                       |

| `testing`                       | The Test Author               | The Skeptic                               |
| `integration`                   | The Builder                   | The Skeptic                               |
| `kickback`                      | (original persona)            | The Skeptic (re-review)                   |
| `spec-writing`                  | The Architect                 | —                                         |
| `research-writing` (technical)  | The Researcher                | —                                         |
| `research-writing` (UX/market)  | The Surveyor                  | —                                         |
| `audit-writing`                 | The Auditor                   | —                                         |
| `bug-report-writing`            | The Bug Hunter                | —                                         |
| `review`                        | The Skeptic                   | —                                         |
| `deepen-audit`                  | The Skeptic                   | —                                         |
| `orchestration`                 | The Lead Engineer             | The Skeptic (merge-gate)                  |
| `documentation`                 | The Documentarian             | The Skeptic                               |

These are **suggested defaults**, not bindings. Of the 13 catalogued mindsets, only **7 ship as skills** — `persona-{architect,auditor,janitor,migrator,performance-surgeon,skeptic,surveyor}` (each at `.agents/skills/persona-<slug>/SKILL.md`). The other 6 mindsets (Builder, Bug Hunter, Documentarian, Lead Engineer, Researcher, Test Author) are carried by the matching workflow skill (Builder → `write-feature`, Bug Hunter → `write-bug-report`, Documentarian → `write-documentation`, Test Author → `write-testing`, Researcher → `write-research`; Lead Engineer = orchestration, no skill). The agent loads the `persona-<slug>` skill whose `description` fits, or relies on the workflow skill's own mindset, and records any divergence in `## Decisions`. ADR 0002 (strict 1-to-1) is superseded to "suggested defaults; agent may re-assess".

## Table 3: Document types × Task types

What triggers what.

The "information loss budget" column is the *maximum* loss permitted at the transition. See [`concepts/03-distillation.md`](../concepts/03-distillation.md) for the loss-budget concept.

## 🛡️ How to use these matrices

- **As a routing oracle.** "I have an `audit.md` — what's the suggested task type?" Look at Table 3.
- **As a persona oracle.** "I have a `feature` task — what's the suggested persona, and does it ship as a skill?" Look at Table 2.
- **As an authorship guide.** "Who should write the ADR?" Look at Table 1.
- **As recommended routing.** These tables are *guidance, not gatekeeper-enforced* — no always-loaded skill blocks a divergent cell. The directive skill `description`s reproduce the routing in-session, and a launcher may apply it deterministically. Diverge by naming the reason in the task file's `## Decisions`.
