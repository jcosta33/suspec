# 🚀 Guide: Quickstart

> The 10-minute path to seeing what Swarm looks like in a real repo. Copy the scaffold; bind a few placeholders; run your first conditioned task.

---

## ⚡ TL;DR

```bash
# From your repo root, with Swarm cloned at $SWARM_REPO
cp -r $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/.agents .
cp -r $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/docs/agents docs/
cp $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/{AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,GEMINI.md} .
cat $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/.gitignore.additions >> .gitignore
mkdir -p .agents/{tasks,specs,audits,bugs,research}

# Edit AGENTS.md's `## Commands` section to bind Validation / Test / Format (+ extended) to your commands.
# Then write a small spec, scaffold a task file, point your agent CLI at it.
```

That's the entire install. Read on for a worked end-to-end example.

## 🪞 What `/scaffold/` is and isn't

The framework's two halves:

- **`/docs/`** — documentation about the framework. *Read* this when you want to understand the framework. Don't copy it.
- **`/scaffold/`** — the literal copyable artefacts. **Self-contained**: every reference inside `/scaffold/` points to other files inside `/scaffold/` (using `.agents/...` paths). Copies cleanly into your repo.

You only ever copy `/scaffold/`. You read `/docs/` for the why.

---

## 🪜 Step 1: Copy the scaffold

```bash
SWARM_REPO=/path/to/swarm   # this Swarm framework repo

# Copy the .agents/ tree, the docs/agents/ process docs, and the entry-point files
cp -r $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/.agents .
cp -r $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/docs/agents docs/
cp $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/AGENTS.md .
cp $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/CLAUDE.md .
cp $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/GEMINI.md .

# Append the gitignore additions
cat $SWARM_REPO/scaffold/.gitignore.additions >> .gitignore

# Create the source-doc directories
mkdir -p .agents/{tasks,specs,audits,bugs,research}
```

Verify the structure:

```bash
ls -1 .agents/skills/                   # 23 skill directories
ls -la .agents/templates/               # 8 flat templates
ls -la docs/agents/                     # 5 process docs
grep -F ".agents/tasks/" .gitignore     # should match
```

---

## 🪜 Step 2: Bind the command contract in AGENTS.md

Open `AGENTS.md`. The scaffold ships with `TODO` markers where your project's specifics belong, and a `## Commands` section — the command contract that skills reference by name (`AGENTS.md > Commands > Validation`, etc.).

```bash
grep -n "TODO" AGENTS.md
```

In the `## Commands` section, replace each `TODO` with your project's command. The **Required** entries (skills rely on them) and an example binding for a TS / pnpm project:

```markdown
| Command      | Template placeholder | Bind to                       |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Validation` | `{{cmdValidate}}`    | `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` |
| `Test`       | `{{cmdTest}}`        | `pnpm test`                   |
| `Format`     | `{{cmdFormat}}`      | `pnpm format`                 |
```

The **Extended** entries (`Install`, `Typecheck`, `Build`, `ValidateDeps`, `Benchmark`) are bound when the relevant work occurs; mark any you don't have `n/a` with a one-line reason.

Also fill in the `## Project conventions` section (language, runtime, test runner, package manager).

---

## 🪜 Step 3: Write a tiny spec

```bash
cat > .agents/specs/example-greet.md <<'EOF'
# Specification: A `greet(name)` function

## Status
Active

## Author
Human (you)

## Context
Quickstart spec to demonstrate Swarm conditioning.

## Linked docs
(none)

## Goal
Add a `greet(name)` function to `src/greet.ts` that returns a friendly greeting.

## Scope
**In scope:**
- `greet(name: string): string` returning `"Hello, <name>!"`

**Out of scope:**
- Internationalisation
- Greeting variations

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] AC1: `greet("Ada")` returns `"Hello, Ada!"`
- [ ] AC2: `greet("")` returns `"Hello, !"` (empty name acceptable for v1)
- [ ] AC3: A unit test exists in `tests/greet.test.ts` exercising both AC1 and AC2.

## Design decisions

### Decision: Plain string concatenation
**Chosen:** Use `\`Hello, \${name}!\``.

**Considered and rejected:**
- _Templating library_ — overkill for a one-line function.

## Constraints
- Honour project conventions (vitest, pnpm).

## Open questions
(none)
EOF
```

## 🪜 Step 4: Scaffold a conditioned task file

In a real install, the Swarm CLI scaffolds this from the spec. For the quickstart, copy the feature skill's task template and fill in the placeholders by hand:

```bash
cp .agents/skills/write-feature/references/task-template.md .agents/tasks/feat-example-greet.md
```

Now edit `.agents/tasks/feat-example-greet.md` and replace:

- `{{title}}` → `Feature: greet function`
- `{{slug}}` → `feat-example-greet`
- `{{branch}}` → `feature/example-greet`
- `{{baseBranch}}` → `main`
- `{{worktreePath}}` → `.worktrees/feat-example-greet` (or wherever you'll work)
- `{{createdAt}}` → today's ISO-8601 timestamp
- `{{specFile}}` → `.agents/specs/example-greet.md`
- The `{{cmd*}}` placeholders → your project's commands (or leave them — your `AGENTS.md > Commands` section already binds them and the agent resolves via that contract)

---

## 🪜 Step 5: Open the task file in your agent CLI

If you have an agent CLI installed (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, etc.):

1. Open the worktree (`cd` into it; or `git worktree add .worktrees/feat-example-greet`)
2. Open `.agents/tasks/feat-example-greet.md` in your agent
3. Tell the agent: *"Read the task file and proceed."*

The agent will:

- Load `write-feature` — the workflow skill that carries The Builder mindset (there's no standalone `persona-builder`; the six mindset-only personas ride in their matching workflow skill)
- Adopt The Builder stance
- Read the spec at `.agents/specs/example-greet.md`
- Plan, then implement `greet`
- Add the test
- Run the validation and test commands (`AGENTS.md > Commands > Validation`, `> Test`)
- Fill in `## Self-review` with pasted output

The whole thing is the framework working as designed: the task file conditions the agent; the agent reads one file and acts.

---

## 🪜 Step 6: What you've done

You now have:

- A Swarm-conformant `.agents/` directory
- An `AGENTS.md` with a `## Commands` section binding the command contract to your project's commands
- The 23 shipped skills installed: 3 quality gates, 1 specialised, 12 authoring, 7 persona skills
- The 8 flat templates ready to use (per-skill task templates live in each skill's `references/task-template.md`)
- One spec (`example-greet.md`)
- One conditioned task file (gitignored)
- (After running the agent) one feature implementation with verification proof

Next steps:

- Read [`adopting-swarm.md`](adopting-swarm.md) for the full adoption walkthrough
- Read [`concepts/`](../concepts/) to understand the framework
- Browse [`personas/`](../personas/) and [`tasks/`](../tasks/) for what each persona / task does
- Try writing a real spec for your project; let the framework take over
