# 🎭 Personas

> The 13 mindsets that condition agents in Swarm. Each persona has its own page; this README is the catalogue and the index.

> 📦 **`/docs/personas/` is conceptual — routing wedges, contrasts, hazards.** Of the 13 mindsets, **7 ship as executable persona skills** (constraints, forbiddances, proofs, red flags) under [`/scaffold/.agents/skills/persona-<slug>/SKILL.md`](../../scaffold/.agents/skills/); the other 6 are carried by the matching workflow skill (see the routing table below).

---

## ⚡ TL;DR

A persona is a **mindset, not a role**. Same agent, same model — different stance, different output. Each task type has a **suggested default persona**; the agent may re-assess when the task in front of it doesn't match (the 1-to-1 mapping is now a default, not a lock — see [ADR 0002](../adrs/0002-personas-1-to-1-with-task-types.md)). Personas have hard rules, forbidden actions, required empirical proofs, and "red flags" — the rationalisations they refuse to accept. Of the 13 mindsets, **7 ship as standalone persona skills**; the other 6 ride along inside the matching workflow skill.

For the conceptual framing, see [`concepts/04-personas.md`](../concepts/04-personas.md).

## 🪜 Persona × Task type matrix (suggested routing)

These are **suggested defaults**, not a lock. A launcher may apply them deterministically when scaffolding a task; in-session the agent loads the skill whose `description` fits and records any divergence in the task file's `## Decisions`. The **Runtime carrier** column names how each lead persona's stance reaches the agent: 🟢 a shipped `persona-<slug>` skill, or 🔵 the workflow skill that carries the mindset (no standalone persona skill).

| Task type            | Lead persona                  | Runtime carrier                                   | Secondary (handoff)                       |

**Carrier legend.** 🟢 shipped persona skill at `scaffold/.agents/skills/persona-<slug>/SKILL.md` (7: architect, auditor, janitor, migrator, performance-surgeon, skeptic, surveyor). 🔵 mindset carried by a workflow skill — Builder→`write-feature`, Bug Hunter→`write-bug-report`, Documentarian→`write-documentation`, Researcher→`write-research`, Test Author→`write-testing`. Lead Engineer ships no skill at all: the orchestration stance lives in the flat `task-orchestration.md` template.

## 🛠️ Project-level overlays

A project can add overlay personas that the framework doesn't ship — for stack-specific or domain-specific work. Common overlay candidates:

| Overlay persona              | Lifts from                                     | Triggering pattern                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Type Surgeon**         | spec-gemini's TypeScript-soundness persona     | TypeScript codebase with strict generics / variance constraints |
| **The Integrator**           | spec-gemini's SDK/MCP wiring persona           | Heavy third-party integration work                            |
| **The Spike Investigator**   | Early exploratory prototyping persona                           | Throwaway spike code answering one bounded question                   |
| **The Security Reviewer**    | (project-defined)                              | Regulated codebase requiring per-PR security audit            |
| **The Accessibility Auditor** | (project-defined)                              | UI codebase with WCAG conformance requirements                |

Overlays ship in consumer repos as their own persona skills under `.agents/skills/persona-<name>/` (beside the shipped seven) — see [`guides/customizing-personas.md`](../guides/customizing-personas.md). They inherit the iron-law pattern but remain project-owned artefacts.

---

## 📐 Profile shape (conceptual — full headings live in `/scaffold`)

Canonical personas embed **constraints, forbiddances, routing tables, proofs, adversarial Self-review deltas, iron-law red-flag tables**. For the 7 shipped personas that literal outline lives in each [`scaffold/.agents/skills/persona-<slug>/SKILL.md`](../../scaffold/.agents/skills/); for the other 6 the same shape is folded into the matching workflow skill so loaders still ingest a uniform stance.

Consult [ADR 0013](../adrs/0013-iron-law-red-flags-pattern.md) for why the iron-law + rationalisation refusal table anchors reliability more than motivational blurbs ever could.

---

## 🚫 Cross-persona anti-patterns

These apply to *every* persona:

- **Blending personas mid-session** ("I'll be a Builder, but also a bit of a Skeptic")
- **Returning to default helpfulness** when the task gets hard — the persona's constraints are most valuable when the work is hardest
- **Treating the persona as a costume** rather than a stance — the constraints are real, the empirical proofs are non-negotiable
- **Self-promoting to a different persona** because you decided the original was wrong — surface the concern, do not switch silently

The framework's response is the **Self-review pass**: each persona skill makes the agent paste empirical proof matching its required proofs before declaring the task done. It is an agent self-assessment baked into the skill, not an external gatekeeper — the discipline holds because the stance demands it of itself.

---

## 🪞 The pre-close checklist (universal)

Before declaring any task complete, every persona verifies:

- [ ] Did I adopt the persona's hard constraints from the start?
- [ ] Did I produce the empirical proofs the persona requires?
- [ ] Did the Self-review focus match the persona's questions?
- [ ] Did I avoid the persona's anti-patterns?
- [ ] If I handed off, did I hand off to the persona's expected partner?
