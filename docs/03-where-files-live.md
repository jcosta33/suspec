# Artifact location and close

## Placement

Place ordinary Suspec artifacts under:

```text
~/.agents/artifacts/<workspace>/
```

Resolve `~` to the absolute home path. Derive `<workspace>` from the repository basename or, outside
a repository, the working-directory basename. Carry the absolute artifact path through every
handoff.

This location is agent-neutral because artifacts are plain Markdown, not harness state. Plan Mode,
vendor-native plans, native memory, source code, build output, and harness-managed state remain with
their owners.

The root is a passive convention. Suspec creates no registry, resolver, configuration, lifecycle
state, cleanup command, symlink, or background process.

## Conflicts

Never overwrite unrelated work. When a workspace name or target path is ambiguous, require a distinct
human-readable name. Do not hash paths or create identity state.

If the root is unwritable, offer:

1. grant access and retry;
2. choose another agent-neutral user directory;
3. cancel.

Never fall back to vendor storage, the repository, or an OS temporary directory.

## Explicit handoffs

Writers resolve and report absolute paths. Dispatch prompts name every input path. The CLI reads only
the primary artifacts and companions it receives.

Artifact-relative checks remain bounded:

- source and citation paths resolve from the checked spec's directory;
- change-plan `SPEC-id#AC-NNN` references scan `spec.md` in the plan directory and immediate sibling
  directories only.

No tool lists, discovers, or resumes work. Recover a lost handoff manually under the known workspace
and pass its absolute path again.

## Close

Keep an artifact while a current or expected step needs it. The final consumer presents one choice for
the complete transient artifact and sidecar set:

- **Delete:** remove it after irreversible-action confirmation.
- **Leave:** keep it at its current neutral paths.
- **Promote:** sanitize and move it into a project-owned durable destination, repair references, and
  validate.

Do not ask at creation or after each revision. Never choose for the human; silence is not Leave.
Promotion never creates Suspec storage or pushes implicitly.

## Durable value

| Live content      | Durable owner                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| intended behavior | code, tests, public contracts, or a project decision record |
| verification      | CI, tests, and PR discussion                                |
| review exceptions | the project action taken on them                            |
| durable lesson    | native memory, issue, test, or maintained documentation     |
| split task        | none; the spec remains the contract                         |
| change strategy   | landed code and project records                             |

A whole artifact enters a repository only through explicit promotion into a project-owned channel.
The adopter otherwise receives no Suspec directory, configuration, scaffold, or gitignore entry.

During live work, code that contradicts intent triggers re-verification and a decision: update the
active spec when intent changed; fix code when implementation drifted. After close, current code and
durable project records govern.
