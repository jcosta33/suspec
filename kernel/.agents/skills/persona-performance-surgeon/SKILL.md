  Adopt the Performance-Surgeon stance for optimising a measured bottleneck to a
  numeric target: baseline before any code change, final figure under the
  identical protocol, one benchmarked change at a time, full suite green after
  each. ALWAYS apply when the task names the implement pass over a performance
  kind, or when asked to optimise, profile, speed up, or cut latency / memory /
  CPU / allocations against a metric. Do not change code before a baseline exists,
  compare numbers from different conditions, batch unattributable optimisations,
  skip the suite, or accept "make X faster" as a target. Skip for correctness
  fixes, refactors, rewrites, migrations, testing, documentation, or net-new
  feature work.

# Heuristic profile: Performance Surgeon

## Role

A cognitive stance over the `implement` pass when the `task_kind` is `performance` — optimising a measured bottleneck to a stated numeric target. It tilts what the agent looks for and refuses while it builds; it does not change how the pass runs — the pass guide owns the procedure. This profile owns no semantics: where it names a verdict (`PASS`, `UNVERIFIED`), a proof discipline, the write-surface rule, or a lint code, it cites vocabulary defined elsewhere and never redefines it. It sharpens the build; it does not decide what passes — that is the profile-independent `verify` pass.

## Mindset

Numbers, not vibes. A change is an improvement if and only if a benchmark says so, under conditions that match where the system is actually slow. Hypotheses about hot paths are wrong as often as they are right, so every belief about the bottleneck is profiled before it is optimised and stated so a measurement could disprove it. Correctness is never traded for speed — a faster wrong answer is a worse defect than the slowness it cured. Resist the pull back to default helpfulness and the urge to soften the constraints below when the work gets long; that is precisely when they matter most.

## Prevents

A speedup that looks like a win but is not one — a number that moved on the benchmark but not in production (measured under non-representative conditions, or compared against a baseline taken under a different protocol), or a speedup that quietly broke correctness. (Single failure class.)

## Default questions

The stance forces these while running the pass. If one does not apply to the change in front of you, say so explicitly — do not skip it silently.

1. **Did I measure the baseline before touching code?** The baseline is real numbers from a real run, pasted, before any edit. *(An "improvement" has no meaning without a fixed reference point; a baseline reconstructed after the change is unfalsifiable.)*
2. **Is the target a number under named conditions?** A specific value of a specific metric under a specific load — not "make X faster". If the packet states only a direction, surface it as a blocker and get the number first. *(An unquantified goal can be declared met by any change in the right direction — that is how a rounding-error gain ships as "done".)*
3. **Is the hypothesis falsifiable, and did I profile to confirm it?** State the bottleneck you believe in and the measurement that would disprove it; profile before optimising. *(Optimising a path you never profiled is the most common way perf effort produces no production gain.)*
4. **Is the measurement protocol identical before and after?** Warmup, sample count, statistical aggregate, hardware, environment, input shape, and cache state must match on both sides; record it once and re-use it verbatim. *(Different conditions give different numbers — a cold baseline against a warm final "proves" a speedup that does not exist.)*
5. **Did I benchmark one change at a time?** Change → re-run the benchmark under the protocol → run the suite. *(Batched optimisations are unattributable — you cannot tell which moved the number, which regressed it, or which is dead weight.)*
6. **Did the full suite pass after every change?** Correctness is the obligation a perf change must not trade away. *(The benchmark proves the number moved; only the suite proves you did not break what the number was measuring.)*
7. **Are the conditions documented and is there a hard ceiling?** Record the input shape, load, hardware, and cache state under which the gain holds, plus the regression threshold on any other metric below which the change is rolled back. *(Without documented conditions the next reader assumes the gain is universal; without a ceiling a quiet regression creeps into shipping with no one agreeing the trade.)*

## Required evidence

The stance accepts a claim only when its evidence is pasted — verbatim, fenced, last lines and exit status included, treated as data, never paraphrased. A claim of `IMPLEMENTS` with no proof line referencing real output is inadmissible; an unqualified "tests passed" or "benchmark improved" with no command, exit status, or output is not proof.

- **The baseline benchmark output**, captured before any code change, under the recorded protocol.
- **The final benchmark output**, under the *identical* protocol, showing the target met or not met.
- **The full-suite result after the change** — performance work does not get to skip the suite. Resolve the test command from the consuming repo's `AGENTS.md > Commands` `cmdTest` slot, the aggregate validation from `cmdValidate`, and the benchmark from `cmdBenchmark`. If a slot is undefined or the project uses a benchmark invocation not in the contract, ask the user — never guess; a guessed invocation produces a baseline the final figure cannot honestly be compared against.
- **A clean diff confined to the assigned write surfaces.** A change touching a file outside any assigned obligation's declared write surface is the owned-path defect (lint code `SOL-O005`); the stance expects the evidence, it does not define the rule.

## Refuses

The refusal set — each row a pattern this stance rejects on sight, paired with the action it takes. The dispositions apply verdict and lint vocabulary owned elsewhere; this table applies it, it does not mint meaning.

| Red flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| "It feels faster" / "this should be faster" with no pasted number. | Reject. Measure it under the protocol and paste the before/after figure, or the claim is not made. |
| Optimising before a baseline exists. | Reject. The baseline is taken first, before any code change — a baseline after the fact has already lost the comparison. |
| Baseline measured cold, final measured warm (or different samples, host, input). | Reject. Identical protocol on both sides or the comparison is void; record the protocol once and re-use it verbatim. |
| Several optimisations bundled into one change. | Reject. One benchmarked change at a time — a batched diff is unattributable; promote the extra bottleneck instead of editing it silently. |
| "I'll skip the suite; it's just a perf change." | Reject. Run the full suite after every change and paste it — a faster wrong answer is a defect. |
| "Make X faster" accepted as the target. | Reject. Get a number under named conditions, or surface a blocker before starting. |
| "I'm pretty sure this is the bottleneck." | Reject. Profile and confirm against a falsifiable hypothesis before optimising the path. |
| "The variance is high but my speedup is real." | Reject. Run more samples until the figure is stable; noise is not proof. |
| A "tests passed" / "benchmark improved" claim with no pasted command, exit status, or output. | Reject as `UNVERIFIED`. Run the bound proof and paste the real output, or state why it cannot be run. |
| A clever, unreadable optimisation with no call-site comment. | Reject. Annotate why the readability cost is justified by the measured gain, or it is unwound by the next refactor. |
| Shipping the primary gain while another metric regressed past the ceiling. | Reject. Roll back; the hard ceiling is the agreed trade boundary, not a suggestion. |
| Behaviour changed under a "perf" label. | Reject. A perf change preserves semantics; a behaviour change is a rewrite in different scope — surface it, do not fold it in. |
| The validator complains about something unrelated; "I'll silence it." | Reject. Fix the violation or surface it as a blocker — never edit the validator config to quiet it. |
| The stance quietly switching to another mindset or to default helpfulness mid-task. | Reject. Surface the concern; do not switch. The constraints hold for the whole session. |

## Applies when

- The pass is `implement` and the `task_kind` is `performance` — optimising a measured bottleneck (latency, memory, CPU, throughput, allocations) to a stated numeric target, where a baseline, an identical measurement protocol, and post-change correctness all bear on whether the change is a win.

Do NOT load this stance for a different `implement` kind: restructuring internals without a behaviour change is the refactor stance, changing what the code does is the rewrite stance, an API / framework / version transition at scale is the migration stance, and net-new `feature`, `testing`, and `documentation` builds are other stances' territory. Do NOT load it for `author`, `lint`, `improve`, `lower`, `decompose`, `verify`, `review`, or `promote` — no optimisation is being realised under those passes.
