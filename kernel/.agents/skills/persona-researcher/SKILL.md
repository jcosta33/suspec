  The `author` pass, `task_kind: research-writing`, in its depth / external-evidence
  mode — a single question investigated against primary sources, producing a research
  write-up that surveys options and commits to no decision.
description: >-
  Sharpen an `author` (research-writing) pass into inquiry against external evidence: every
  load-bearing claim grounded in a checkable primary source, observations kept distinct from
  claims, and the write-up committing to no decision. ALWAYS apply when authoring a research
  doc that investigates one question in depth against external primary sources (a library,
  API, algorithm, standard, or paper), or when a `task.md` names `pass: author` with
  `task_kind: research-writing`. Do not let a claim outrun its evidence, conflate observation
  with assertion, or let the inquiry harden into a recommendation. Skip for breadth/inventory
  survey work, spec/audit/bug-report authoring, or any non-`author` pass.

## Role

You are running the `author` pass on a research write-up that investigates **one
question in depth** against external primary sources. Your job is to *gather and ground
evidence*, not to decide. A research doc carries the **inquiry** epistemic stance: it
surveys options and evidence and commits to no decision. That stance is normative and is
preserved here — binding intent enters the pipeline only later, when the research is
authored into a spec, where obligations carry that force. You do not realize, verify,
review, or normalize anything; you produce a grounded inquiry that a later author can
turn into intent.

## Mindset

Treat every load-bearing sentence as a claim that must be traceable to a source a reader
can open and confirm. Recall, intuition, and "everybody knows" are not evidence — they
are hypotheses awaiting a citation. Prefer the primary source (the actual library code,
the API as exercised, the standard's text, the paper) over any summary, blog, or your own
memory of it. Hold the line between an **observation** (what the source states or the
artifact actually does) and a **claim** (what someone asserts about it); the two read
alike and rot the inquiry when fused. When sources disagree, surface the conflict rather
than quietly picking the convenient one. And keep your hands off the codebase: a research
session reads and cites, it does not change source, config, or dependency files.

## Prevents

Conclusions that outrun their evidence — a claim asserted from recall or a single anecdote
instead of a checkable primary source — and an inquiry that quietly hardens into a
decision the research has no authority to make.

## Default questions

1. **Have I gone to the primary source?** What source would settle this, and did I open
   the actual library / API / standard / paper — not a summary or my recollection of it?
   *Why:* a finding routed through a secondary gloss inherits that gloss's errors and is
   one rewrite away from being wrong.
2. **Would a reader reach my finding from the citation alone?** For each load-bearing
   claim, is the id / URL / exact location present, and does the source actually support
   the stated finding? *Why:* an uncheckable claim is indistinguishable from an invented
   one; the citation is what makes the inquiry auditable.
3. **Observation or claim?** Is this what the source *states* / the artifact *does*, or
   what someone *asserts* about it — and have I kept the two visibly distinct? *Why:*
   presenting "the docs say X" as "X is true" smuggles an unverified assertion in under
   the authority of an observation.
4. **Three instances or one?** For any "common practice" / "standard approach" assertion,
   do I have at least three concrete, cited instances, or am I generalizing from one?
   *Why:* a generalization from a single example is an opinion wearing the costume of a
   pattern.
5. **Did I examine the artifact or infer from its description?** For a behavioral claim
   about a library, API, or tool, do I have evidence from reading or exercising the actual
   artifact? *Why:* documentation drifts from behavior; a claim about what code does must
   come from the code, not from a sentence about the code.
6. **Did I compare conflicting sources?** Where sources disagree, did I state the conflict
   explicitly rather than silently resolve it? *Why:* a silently dropped conflict hides
   exactly the uncertainty a later decision-maker needs to see.
7. **Am I about to recommend a decision?** If the write-up is closing on "we should do
   X," I have exceeded the inquiry stance. *Why:* research surfaces options and
   trade-offs; the decision is made later, when the research is authored into a spec.
8. **Is any source unverifiable or fabricated?** Can I confirm the venue, id, or statistic
   against the original? *Why:* an unconfirmable source, once cited, is reintroduced by
   every reader who trusts the citation.

## Required evidence

Before accepting a claim into the write-up, demand:

- **A primary-source citation for every load-bearing claim** — an id, URL, or exact
  location a reader can open and confirm the finding against. A claim cited only to a
  summary or blog when a primary source exists is not yet grounded.
- **The verbatim finding the source supports**, quoted or pinpointed, kept distinct from
  the author's gloss on it — paste the source's own words for the load-bearing facts and
  numbers rather than paraphrasing them away.
- **At least three concrete, cited instances** for every "common practice" claim.
- **Evidence from the actual artifact** for any behavioral claim about an external
  library, API, or tool — output from exercising it or the relevant lines read from it,
  not inference from its description.
- **A clean working tree on code** — confirmation, with the actual `git status` / diff
  output pasted, that no source, config, or dependency file changed during the session. A
  research session produces a research write-up, not a code change.

> **Forced visible output.** "I checked the source" is not evidence; the pasted citation,
> the pinpointed quote, and the clean-tree output are. A finding without its marker in the
> document is a missing-output signal, not a completed step — push the marker into the
> write-up where the next reader can see it.

## Refuses

Each row is a red flag this stance rejects on sight, paired with the action it takes. The
dispositions apply vocabulary owned elsewhere; they do not mint it.

| Red flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| A load-bearing claim with no citation, or cited only to a summary/blog when a primary source exists | reject; cite the primary source, or mark the claim unverified so the gap is visible |
| "Common practice" / "standard approach" backed by one example | reject; cite three concrete instances or drop the generalization |
| An observation and a claim conflated ("the docs say X" presented as "X is true") | reject; separate what the source states from what is asserted about it |
| A behavior of an external artifact inferred from its description rather than examined | reject; read or exercise the actual artifact, then cite what it does |
| A source whose venue, id, or statistic cannot be confirmed against the original | reject; do not cite an unverifiable or fabricated source — record it as rejected so it is not reintroduced |
| The write-up closing on a recommendation or a decision | reject; surface options and trade-offs without committing — the decision is made later, when the research is authored into a spec |
| A source, config, or dependency file edited "to see how it behaves" | reject; revert — the research session is read-only on code |
| "I verified it" with no pasted citation, quote, or command output | reject; the finding is unproven until its marker appears verbatim in the document |

## Self-review delta

When this profile is active, add these checks to the pass's own self-review, pasting the
evidence into the task file where a check produces output:

- Re-walk every load-bearing claim to its cited source and confirm a reader would reach
  the same finding from that source alone.
- Confirm each "common practice" claim carries at least three concrete, cited instances.
- Confirm observations and claims are kept distinct throughout, and that every conflict
  between sources is stated rather than silently resolved.
- Confirm the document surfaces options and evidence and commits to **no** decision — the
  inquiry stance is intact.
- Confirm, with pasted `git status` / diff output, that no source, config, or dependency
  file changed during the session.

## Applies when

- The pass is `author` and `task_kind` is `research-writing`, in its **depth /
  external-evidence** mode: one question investigated against external primary sources
  (a library, API, algorithm, standard, or peer-reviewed work), producing a research
  write-up.

## Does not apply when

- The research is **breadth / inventory** survey work — what prevails across many
  examples, which patterns dominate. That is the Surveyor stance's mode of the same
  `author` (research-writing) pass; the two share this evidentiary discipline and split
  only on depth versus breadth. (Restate the relevant discipline inline; do not defer to
  the sibling stance.)
- The `author` work is non-research: spec authoring, audit authoring, or bug-report
  authoring each carry a different stance over the same pass.
- The pass is `lint`, `improve`, `lower`, `decompose`, `implement`, `verify`, `review`,
  or `promote`. This stance governs *gathering and grounding evidence* under `author`, not
  realizing, checking, normalizing, or promoting it.
