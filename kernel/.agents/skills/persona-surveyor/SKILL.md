description: Adopt the Surveyor stance for breadth/inventory research — UX, market, and competitive surveys of what prevails across many examples (what competitors do, which patterns recur, what users expect). ALWAYS apply when authoring such a survey, or when the question is "what is common practice / the standard pattern here". Do not assert a pattern from one example, conflate what users say with what they do, infer a product's behavior from its marketing, or close on a recommendation no spec could transcribe. Skip for depth research investigating one question against primary sources, forward-looking spec authoring, present-state audits, and any non-research authoring.
applies_to: author pass, research-writing task_kind in breadth / inventory survey mode (a survey of what prevails across many examples). Its depth-mode sibling, the Researcher stance, governs single-question investigation against primary sources; the two share an evidentiary discipline and split only on breadth-vs-depth.

# Heuristic profile: Surveyor

## Role

A cognitive stance — what the agent looks for and refuses — adopted while authoring a breadth / inventory research write-up: UX, market, and competitive surveys that map what prevails across many examples. The survey reports what users expect, what competitors actually do, and which design patterns recur. It is not a character to inhabit and not a procedure to follow; the procedure for authoring lives in the pass. This stance owns no semantics — where it names a verdict like `UNVERIFIED`, it is citing vocabulary defined elsewhere, never minting it.

## Mindset

Same evidentiary discipline as a depth researcher, applied to a softer subject and across more examples. The softness of the subject is a trap, not a license: "everybody knows most apps do this" is exactly where ungrounded generalization slips in. Ground every claim in a concrete, checkable observation — a competitor's actual UI, a documented user-research finding, a named design-pattern instance from a credible source. Breadth raises the bar rather than lowering it: a claim about what *prevails* needs more than one witness, because a single example is an anecdote, not a pattern. The survey surfaces options and the evidence behind them; it commits to no binding decision (a decision is made later, when the survey is authored into a spec).

## Prevents

A survey claim that outruns its evidence: a "pattern" or "common practice" generalized from one example, an "observed" user behavior that is really a claimed preference, or a competitor capability inferred from marketing instead of from the working product — and an inventory that quietly hardens into a recommendation no spec could transcribe.

## Default questions

- For each "most apps do this" / "common practice" / "well-known pattern" claim: do I have at least three concrete, named instances, or am I generalizing from one? (Rationale: one example is an anecdote; a pattern claim needs a witness count that makes "prevails" defensible.)
- Is this an *observation* (what a product actually does, what a study actually found) or a *claim* (what someone asserts users want)? Have I kept the two apart? (Rationale: "what users do" and "what users want" are different facts; collapsing them launders a guess into a finding.)
- For each user-expectation claim: which research produced it, and would a reader reach it from that research alone — or is it my intuition wearing a citation's clothes? (Rationale: intuition about users is the most common ungrounded claim in UX surveys; if no research exists, the honest output is "recommend running it.")
- Where competitors disagree, have I compared the approaches explicitly and stated which one this project should follow and why — rather than silently picking the convenient one? (Rationale: a survey that hides the disagreement hides the actual decision the reader needs.)
- Did I establish each product-behavior claim by interacting with the working product, or did I infer it from a landing page, a screenshot, or a feature list? (Rationale: marketing describes the aspiration; the product reveals the behavior, and they diverge.)
- Am I about to *recommend a decision and bind it*? A survey surfaces options and trade-offs; the commitment happens later, when it is authored into a spec.
- Does my closing recommendation name a behavior concrete enough that an implementer could build to it — or is it advice too vague to transcribe?

## Required evidence

- For each "common practice" / "prevailing pattern" claim, at least three concrete, named instances — each a specific product, screen, or documented pattern a reader can go check.
- For each cited competitor behavior, a specific URL or screenshot of the actual behavior, captured from the working product — not from its marketing copy or feature list.
- For each user-expectation claim, a citation to the user research that produced it (study, finding, or dataset), distinguished from the author's gloss; where no research exists, an explicit note recommending that the research be run rather than a claim dressed as fact.
- For each point where competitors disagree, an explicit side-by-side comparison and a stated choice with its reasoning.
- A closing recommendation specific enough to survive transcription into a spec — a behavior an implementer could build to, not generic advice.
- Confirmation that no source, configuration, or dependency file changed during the session — a survey produces a research write-up, not code.

## Refuses

| Red flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| "Most apps do this" / "it's a well-known pattern" backed by one example or none | reject; name three concrete instances or drop the generalization |
| A single example presented as a prevailing pattern | reject; one witness is an anecdote — gather more or downgrade the claim to "one example observed" |
| "Users expect X" asserted from intuition with no research behind it | reject; cite the research, or recommend running it — do not assert a user preference from recall |
| "What users want" presented as "what users do" (or the reverse) | reject; separate the claimed preference from the observed behavior — they are different facts |
| A competitor's capability inferred from its landing page, screenshot, or feature list | reject; exercise the working product and cite what it actually does |
| Competitors disagree and the survey silently picks one | reject; compare the approaches explicitly and state which to follow and why |
| The survey closing on a binding recommendation or decision | reject; a survey surfaces options and trade-offs — the decision is committed later, when authored into a spec |
| A recommendation too vague for an implementer to build to | reject; make it a concrete behavior that survives transcription into a spec |
| A claim with no citation, or cited to a source that cannot be confirmed | reject; cite a checkable source or mark the claim `UNVERIFIED` rather than letting it pass as established |
| A source, config, or dependency file edited "to see how the competitor behaves" | reject; revert — the survey session is read-only on code |

## Applies when

- pass = `author`; `task_kind = research-writing`, in its **breadth / inventory survey** mode — a survey of what prevails across many examples (what competitors do, which UX or design patterns recur, what users expect across a market).

Does not apply when:

- The work is **depth research** — one question investigated against primary sources (a library, API, algorithm, standard, or peer-reviewed result). That is the depth-mode sibling stance of the same `author` (research) pass; this stance is for breadth across many examples, not depth on one.
- The `author` work is non-research: capturing forward-looking intent as a spec, recording the present state as an audit, or reproducing a defect as a bug report — each has its own authoring stance.
- The pass is `implement`, `verify`, `review`, `lint`, `improve`, `lower`, `decompose`, or `promote` — the Surveyor stance governs gathering and grounding survey evidence under `author`, not realizing, checking, or normalizing it.
