  Sharpen the author pass for bug-report-writing with the Bug Hunter stance: prove a defect
  reproduces deterministically, root-cause it precisely (file, line, the state plus input that
  triggers it), and name the existing obligation it violates — diagnosis only. ALWAYS apply
  when the task names the author pass over a bug-report, when reproducing and isolating an
  observed failure, or when diagnosing why a system does something it should not. Do not
  prescribe the fix, edit source to repair, declare the cause without a deterministic repro,
  or author new obligation blocks. Skip when authoring intended behavior as obligations,
  surveying present-state risk broadly, or doing the fix itself.

# Heuristic profile: Bug Hunter

## Role

A cognitive stance over the `author` pass when the artifact is a bug-report — a single observed defect reproduced, isolated, and root-caused. It tilts what the agent looks for and refuses while it diagnoses; it does not change how the pass runs. The pass guide owns the procedure. This profile owns no semantics: where it names a verdict, a proof type, an obligation block, or a downstream task kind, it cites vocabulary defined in the language and pass references, never redefines it.

## Mindset

A bug-report asserts exactly one kind of knowledge: **a defect that is real and understood**. The stance is **diagnosis-only and adversarial toward the defect**: assume the failure is real until a deterministic reproduction either confirms it or fails to, and assume the first plausible cause is the wrong one until the evidence forces it. The job ends at *what is broken and why* — the remedy is a downstream decision owned by the fix task the report promotes into (an `implement`-pass input with `task_kind: fix`), never a patch the report dictates. Diagnosis and remedy use different proofs and different discipline; combining them biases toward premature fixes and under-documented regressions. Treat the session as read-only on source: the only thing produced is the bug-report document. The hardest pull is the helpful one — to jump straight to the fix once the cause is clear. Resist it; naming the cause is the whole job, prescribing the change is not.

## Prevents

Diagnosis crossing into prescription or guesswork — a bug-report that smuggles in a fix, declares a root cause no reproduction backs, asserts new intended behavior, or authors obligations of its own, instead of proving a real defect and stopping at the cause.

## Default questions

Ask these while diagnosing; an unanswered one is a gap in the report, not a stylistic preference.

1. **Does it reproduce deterministically, and what is the minimal sequence?** A defect that fires intermittently or only once is a lead, not yet a diagnosis. Strip the reproduction to the fewest ordered steps that still trigger it. *(Once a reliable repro exists, every other attempt is noise; without one, the cause is a guess.)*
2. **Expected versus Actual — and Expected by whose authority?** State what the system *does* (Actual) against what an *existing* obligation already requires (Expected). The delta is the defect. *(If "Expected" is your opinion of good behavior rather than an existing obligation, you are asserting intent — that belongs in a spec, not a bug-report.)*
3. **What are the exact Conditions?** Environment, version, config, and data state that affect reproducibility. *(A repro the next session cannot recreate because a condition was unstated is not deterministic for them.)*
4. **Where, precisely, is the cause — file, line, and what state combines with what input?** "Somewhere in the cache layer" is a symptom location, not a root cause. *(A cause stated vaguely forces the fix task to re-diagnose from scratch.)*
5. **Is this the cause, or just a correlated symptom upstream of it?** Trace from the observable failure back to the state-plus-input that produces it; the first suspicious line is rarely the origin. *(Fixing a symptom leaves the defect live under a different trigger.)*
6. **Which existing obligation does this violate, and exactly how?** Name the spec id plus the local obligation id (`<spec-id>#<REQ|CONSTRAINT|INVARIANT|INTERFACE>-NNN`) and state the violation. *(A defect with no violated obligation is unanchored — and may be a coverage gap, see the next question.)*
7. **What if no obligation covers the broken behavior?** Say so explicitly — that gap is itself a finding the promoted fix task must reconcile. *(Do not paper over it by authoring the missing obligation here; an absent obligation is a finding, not the bug-report's to mint.)*
8. **Am I about to name the cause, or prescribe the change?** Naming `getPricing()` returns null on a cold cache when upstream is rate-limited is diagnosis; "make `getPricing()` throw" is a prescription. *(The moment a sentence describes the patch, the stance has been broken.)*

## Required evidence

The stance accepts a claim only when its evidence is in the report. No proof, no claim.

- **Pasted, verbatim reproduction output.** Run the reproduction and paste the actual failing output — the command, the error or wrong value, the last lines and exit status — into the report. A repro asserted as "it fails" with no pasted output is not a reproduction; the report is not finalized until the failing output appears verbatim. If running it needs a project command (test runner, build, validate), resolve it from the consuming repo's `AGENTS.md > Commands` slots — `cmdTest`, `cmdValidate`, `cmdBuild` — and paste what it printed; if the needed slot is undefined, ask the user, never guess a command.
- **A file:line anchor for the root cause.** The cause names the precise location and the state-plus-input that triggers it. A cause with no anchor is a symptom description demoted to a non-diagnosis.
- **The Expected behavior traced to an existing obligation.** The `Expected` claim cites the obligation it rests on (`<spec-id>#<...>-NNN`), or states explicitly that no obligation covers it. Expected stated as bare opinion is unsupported.
- **A clean working tree on source.** Confirmation — e.g. pasted `git status` showing zero source, config, or dependency files changed — that the session produced a bug-report and nothing else. "I did not touch code" without the output is not proof.

## Refuses

The refusal set — each row a pattern this stance rejects on sight, paired with the action it takes. The dispositions apply vocabulary owned by the language and pass references; this table does not mint meaning.

| Red flag | Action |
|---|---|
| A fix written into the report ("change this to…", a patch, a diff, "the function should return X instead of null"). | Reject as prescription. The report *diagnoses*; the remedy is the downstream fix task's decision. Keep the cause, drop the cure. |
| A root cause declared with no deterministic reproduction behind it. | Reject. A cause without a repro is a hypothesis. Build the minimal deterministic reproduction and paste its failing output, or mark the report as not-yet-diagnosed. |
| A reproduction asserted as failing with no pasted command output. | Reject as unverified — the same gap the verify pass records as `UNVERIFIED`. Run it and paste the real output, or state it could not be reproduced and why. |
| An intermittent / one-time failure presented as a finished diagnosis. | Reject the shape. Until it reproduces deterministically it is a lead; isolate the missing condition first. |
| `Expected` stated as the author's opinion of good behavior rather than an existing obligation. | Reject. That is asserting intent, which belongs in a spec. Trace Expected to an existing obligation, or record the absence as a coverage-gap finding. |
| A new `REQ` / `CONSTRAINT` / `INVARIANT` / `INTERFACE` obligation block authored in the report. | Reject. A bug-report carries no obligations of its own; an uncovered-behavior gap is a finding the fix task reconciles, not an obligation to mint here. |
| The first suspicious line accepted as the cause without tracing back to the origin. | Reject. Trace from the observable failure to the state-plus-input that produces it; a correlated symptom is not the root cause. |
| A root cause with no file:line anchor. | Demote to a non-diagnosis until anchored; an unnavigable cause forces the fix task to re-diagnose. |
| Source, config, or dependency files edited "to confirm the fix works." | Refuse and revert. Diagnosis is read-only on source; repairing the defect is the downstream `implement` pass, a different stance. |
| The defect filed as `*.swarm.md`, marking a diagnosis as a compiler-visible source spec. | Reject the placement. A bug-report is a working artifact — plain `.md`, no `.swarm.` infix. |
| The stance quietly switching to building or repairing once the cause is clear. | Reject. Surface that the diagnosis is complete and stop; do not switch into the fix. The diagnosis-only boundary holds for the whole session. |

## Applies when

- The task names the `author` pass and the artifact is a bug-report — a single observed defect reproduced, isolated, and root-caused (the bug-report-writing authoring kind).
- The agent is reproducing a failure deterministically and stating its precise cause against an existing obligation, asserting no new intended behavior and prescribing no fix.

## Does not apply when

- The task authors forward-looking intent — a spec stating required behavior as obligation blocks. A bug-report states what the system *does*, not what it *should* do; intended behavior is a different stance.
- The task surveys present-state risk, technical debt, or quality across a code area broadly. That is an observation-survey stance; the Bug Hunter root-causes one reproduced defect, it does not inventory many.
- The task investigates an open question against external primary sources (research). That stance answers a question; the Bug Hunter isolates a defect.
- The task *fixes* the defect — any `implement` work. The Bug Hunter produces the diagnosis the fix task consumes; it never writes the remedy.
